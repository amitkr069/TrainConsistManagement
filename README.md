### Use Case 6: Map Bogie to Capacity (HashMap)


#### Goal was to -> 
Associate each bogie with its seating or load capacity using a key–value mapping structure.


#### Flow

User creates a bogie-capacity mapping.

System stores bogie names as keys and capacities as values.

Entries are inserted into a HashMap.

System iterates through the map.

Capacity details are displayed for each bogie.

Program continues.



#### Key Concepts Used in Use Case 6

HashMap – A hash table based implementation of the Map interface that stores data in key–value pairs, allowing each bogie to be mapped directly to its seating or load capacity.

Map Interface – A collection type in Java that represents a mapping between unique keys and their corresponding values, ideal for associating bogies with operational attributes.

put() Method – Inserts a key–value pair into the map, where the bogie name becomes the key and the capacity becomes the value.

Key–Value Association – Models real-world relationships by binding a bogie to its property, such as binding "Sleeper" to 72 seats.

entrySet() Iteration – Provides a view of the entire map as a set of entries, allowing iteration over both keys and values together.

Fast Lookup Using Keys – HashMap allows constant-time retrieval of capacity using a bogie name as the key, making planning and validation efficient.



#### Key Benefits

Models real-world attribute mapping in software systems.

Introduces key–value data representation instead of flat collections.

Enables fast lookup and validation of bogie properties.

Prepares students for enterprise data modeling patterns.

Builds the foundation for analytics and planning use cases in later UCs.
